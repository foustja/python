# python
This directory contains files written in python (primarily 2.7) which do various things, mostly calculate and display the 
Mandelbrot set, and in one or more cases make use of the TkSnack toolkit to create sounds related to tte Mandelbrot set. The 
Mandelbrot programs are heavily commented and contain detailed explanations of how the set is generated and displayed. There 
are some sections of code that are commented out as a result of efforts (sometimes unsuccessful) to solve certain coding
problems.
