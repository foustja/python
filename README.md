# python

This directory contains files written in python (primarily 2.7) which do various things, mostly calculate and display the 
Mandelbrot set. In one or more cases they also make use of the TkSnack toolkit to create sounds related to the Mandelbrot set. 

The Mandelbrot programs are heavily commented and contain detailed explanations of how the set is generated and displayed, and also where to find certain resources (such as TkSnack). There are some sections of code that are commented out as a result of efforts (sometimes unsuccessful) to solve certain coding problems.
